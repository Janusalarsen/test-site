This project is a test website in order for me to practice web development.
I am currently undergoing The Odin Project course, and part of that is creating a test-site to practice:
- Git and Github
- html
- css
- and javascript

At the moment of writing this I am in the progress of learning javascript, and started making a draft of my first web page.
The web page in its current stage can be seen on this url: https://janusalarsen.github.io/test-site/

TEST CHANGE!
